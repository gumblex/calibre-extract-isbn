Extract ISBN
============

This is a Python 3 fork of the original *Extract ISBN* Calibre plugin.

From the [original post](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=126727):

> \[GUI Plugin\] Extract ISBN
> This plugin can be used to try to find the ISBN for a book using the text within a book format. It is intended as an alternative to various script based solutions to this problem posted in [this thread](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=50691).
